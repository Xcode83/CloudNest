CloudNest - A Secure Client-Side S3 Browser

A modern, fast, and secure web interface to browse and manage your AWS S3 buckets. Built with React and Vite, CloudNest runs entirely in your browser, ensuring your AWS credentials are never sent to any server except AWS itself.

‚ú® Features
üîê Secure Client-Side Connection: Credentials are held only in browser memory for the session. They are gone when you close the tab.
üóÇÔ∏è Full File & Folder Navigation: Easily browse through folders with intuitive breadcrumb navigation.
‚¨ÜÔ∏è Simple File Uploads: Upload files directly to the current S3 path.
‚ûï Create Folders: Organize your bucket by creating new folders on the fly.
‚¨áÔ∏è Secure Downloads: Download files using temporary, presigned URLs generated by the AWS SDK.
üóëÔ∏è Delete Files & Folders: Cleanly remove objects and entire folder structures from your S3 bucket.
üíª Modern UI: A clean, responsive interface built with modern CSS for a great user experience.
üöÄ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Vite
API Integration: AWS SDK for JavaScript v3
Styling: Modern CSS
Deployment: Client-side build, ready for any static host.
üõ°Ô∏è The Security Model
Handling user credentials is a huge responsibility. This application was designed with a "security-first" approach:
Client-Side Only: The entire application logic runs in your browser. There is no backend server that could intercept your keys.
In-Memory Storage: Your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, and Bucket information are stored exclusively in React's state (in-memory). They are never written to localStorage, sessionStorage, or any file on disk.
Direct to AWS: The AWS SDK communicates directly from your browser to AWS endpoints.
Session-Based: When you close the browser tab, your credentials are wiped from memory permanently.
‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
To run this project, you need two things: a properly configured AWS account and the project files running on your local machine.
1. AWS S3 & IAM Setup
For CloudNest to connect, you need an AWS user with S3 permissions and a bucket with the correct CORS configuration.
Step A: Create an IAM User
Navigate to the IAM service in your AWS Console.
Go to Users and click "Add users".
Give the user a name (e.g., cloudnest-s3-user).
Select "Access key - Programmatic access" for the credential type.
Click "Next: Permissions".
Choose "Attach existing policies directly".
Search for and select the AmazonS3FullAccess policy. (For production, it's better to create a more restrictive policy, but this is fine for personal use.)
Click through the remaining steps and click "Create user".
IMPORTANT: On the final screen, copy both the Access key ID and the Secret access key. You will not be able to see the secret key again.
Step B: Configure S3 Bucket CORS
Navigate to the S3 service in your AWS Console.
Select the bucket you want to connect to.
Go to the "Permissions" tab.
Scroll down to "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)" and click "Edit".
Paste the following JSON into the text field. This allows your local machine (and a future deployed site) to make requests to your bucket.
Generated json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedOrigins": [
        "http://localhost:5173",
        "https://your-deployed-site.com"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
Use code with caution.
Json
Remember to replace https://your-deployed-site.com with your actual website URL when you deploy it.
